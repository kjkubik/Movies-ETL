ETL Movie Data

What you should know: This was strickly to practice ETL. This is something I have had ample practice doing during my career. My explanations in the code are enough documentation. I am good at making sure people know what's going on during the ETL processing I have created.

## Task Summary:
1. Extract and transform the wiki and kaggle data files into a single dataframe. 
2. Check the dataframe is correct.
3. Loaded results into the 'movie' table. 
4. ETL for ratings data file. Resulting table is ratings. 

NOTE: There is only one of these files in Resources (the wiki file) because the data was too large to upload to git. If you need the data it can be downloaded in Kaggle.
